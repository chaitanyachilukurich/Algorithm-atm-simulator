- Withdraw: Inputs: Account number, withdrawal amount. Action: Deducts the withdrawal amount from the account balance.

### Some security features of our code includes or to be included are:
- PIN Validation: Not implemented in this version but can be added for enhanced security.
- Account Number Verification: Ensures that only valid account numbers are accepted.

### For testing and validation we have taken care of the mentioned items below.
- Invalid Input: Displays error messages for incorrect input formats.
- Insufficient Funds: Alerts users when attempting to withdraw more than their account balance.
- Invalid Account Number: Notifies users when entering an unrecognized account number.
- Unit Testing: Validates the functionality of individual methods.
- Integration Testing: Verifies the interaction between different components.
- User Acceptance Testing: Involves real users to ensure usability and reliability.
### For future enhancements we have few things in our mind for the codebase such as:
- PIN-Based Authentication: Implement PIN validation for user authentication.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Develop a GUI for a more intuitive user experience.
- Database Integration: Store user account data in a database for scalability and persistence.
